# Banking-Management
Objective of this Assignment:
• To design a miniature Project for a Banking Management System using Java,
SQL and JDBC.
Requisite:
• Completion of IDB Laboratory Assignment-4
• Basic Java Programming knowledge.
Overview of the Project:
A Banking Management System is to be designed, putting together the
concepts learnt in theory and practised in laboratory. The Project will integrate
a Java frontend menu driven program to the backend Banking Database
designed in Oracle through JDBC connectivity.
Project Description: The Java program provides an interface to the user to
access, insert, delete and update the database. The program handles user input,
output to and from the database for the said operations. User should be able to
do the following operations:

1. Show Customer Records:
Using this option, the details of all the customers should be
displayed in particular format.
2. Add Customer Record:
Using this option, the user needs to provide the information
such as cust_no, name, phoneno and city through user input,
which will be saved in database. After that using option 1, 
details of all the customers will be displayed in particular
format.
3. Delete Customer Record:
Using this option, the user needs to provide the cust_no of a
customer through user input and all the information related
to that customer will be deleted from the database. After that
using option 1, details of all the customers will be displayed in
particular format.
4. Update Customer Information:
Using this option, the user needs to provide the cust_no of a
customer through user input and based on the following
choice the information related to the customer will be
updated.
4.1: Update name
4.2:Update Phoneno.
4.3: Update city
After that using option 1, details of all the customers will be
displayed in particular format.
5. Show Account Details of a Customer:
Using this option, the user needs to provide the cust_no of a
customer through user input and all the information of that
customer along with his account_no, type, balance,
branch_code, branch_name and branch_city will be displayed
in proper format. 
6. Show Loan Details of a Customer:
Using this option, the user needs to provide the cust_no of a
customer through user input and all the information of that
customer along with his loan_no, loan amount, branch_code,
branch_name and branch_city will be displayed in proper
format.
7. Deposit Money to an Account:
Using this option, the user needs to provide the account_no of
a customer and the amount to be deposited through user
input. According to the deposited amount the updated
balance will be verified in proper format using option 5.
8. Withdraw Money from an Account:
Using this option, the user needs to provide the account_no of
a customer and the amount to be withdraw through user
input. According to the withdraw amount the updated
balance will be verified in proper format using option 5.
9. Exit the Program
The operations are choice based. Appropriate option has to be chosen from a
switch casebased menu driven program and the operation on the database is
performed accordingly. The output is displayed in the terminal screen with
appropriate messages from the database as displayed by MySQL during direct
access. Exceptions should be handled properly by the Java program. The output
should be displayed in a formatted way for clarity of understanding and visual.
